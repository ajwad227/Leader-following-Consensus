Observer based leader-following consensus of second-order multi-agent systems with nonuniform sampled position data. Journal of the Franklin Institute, 356(16), 10031-10057.

The time at which a robot measures its position is highly important in the proposed algorithms.
Therefore, it is necessary that the clocks of all the machines on the network are synchronized. This can
be achieved by incorporating Network Time Protocol (NTP) in the network.
